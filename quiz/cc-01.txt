::Q1::What was the main shortcoming of the "B" language?  (a precursor to C)
{
=It was not good at handling bytes (b-bit characters)
~It did not use indentation as syntax
~It did not support the FORTRAN FORMAT statement
~It did not have first class functions
}

::Q2::When was the C language "under construction" as it was
co-evolving with the creation of UNIX?
{
=1975
~1965
~1985
~1980
}

::Q3::What was a key goal in the design of the C language?
{
=Reduce the need to write assembly language in UNIX
~Implement all the core structures of Python (list, dict, tuple)
~The need to precisely describe the headers in the TSP/IO protocols
~Replicating the FORTRAN PRINT and computer GOTO language elements
}

::Q4::The C *language* has no provisions for Input/Output in the language.
Where do C developers find Input/Output capabilities when writing C?
{
=In standard libraries
~In FORTRAN
~In the pre-processor
~On a USB stick
}

::Q5::Which organization created the first official C standard?
{
=ANSI
~ISO
~Posix
~IETF
}

::Q6::Which of the following was pre-1978?
{
=FORTRAN was created
~Linux was created
~Minix was created
~C++ was created
}

::Q7::Before UNIX, what was the most popular portable operating system?
{
=None of these
~Lunix
~Minix
~MTS (Michigan Terminal System)
~ARPANET
}

::Q8::What computer inspired the rewrite of UNIX and creation of C?
{
=DEC PDP 11/20
~DEC VAX
~DEC PDP 1
~Interdata 7/32
}

::Q9::In 1978, about what percentage of UNIX was written in Assembly
Language?
{
=5%
=25%
=50%
=100%
}

::Q10::Which of these came first?
{
=Minix
~Linux
~Debian
~Windows 95
}

::Q11::What operating system powers most of the AWS
(Amazon Web Servces) server resources?
{
=Linux
~UNIX
~Minix
~Windows
}

::Q10::Which of these came first?
{
=Multics
~Minix
~Unix
~Liunx
}

::Q11::Which university produced and distributed a very popular
UNIX distribution in the 1970's?
{
=University of Berkeley
~Stanford Univerity
~MIT
~Harvard
}

::Q11::What went wrong in the late 1980's that took UNIX out of 
the running to be the universal operating system?  This action
led to the creation of a series of UNIX-like operating systems that now
dominate the market.
{
=The owners of UNIX tried to make money with it by using
restrictive licensing
~UNIX's lack of support for FORTRAN was a major barrier to adoption
~UNIX was never able to fully support the emerging TCP/IP
stack needed for ARPANET, NSFNet, and the modern Internet
~C Pointers were just too complex for the average programmer to understand.
}

::Q12::What company created UNIX and C?
{
=AT&T
~IBM
~Sun Microsystems
~Microsoft
}
