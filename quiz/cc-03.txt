instance from a class?
{
=Python
~Java
~JavaScript
~PHP
~C++
}

::Q2::Most OO Patterns use the period or dot (.) operator to access an
attribute within an instance.  Which language does not support use the dot
operator to access an attribute within an instance
{
~Python
~Java
~JavaScript
=PHP
~C++
}

::Q3::Which OO language was initially implemented using a pre-processing pass?
{
~Python
~Java
~JavaScript
~PHP
=C++
}

::Q4::What is the country where the Simula language was developed?
{
~Finland
~Switzerland
~The Netherlands
~Denmark
=Norway
}


::Q5::What is the country where the creator of C++ was pursuing a Ph.D. when 
he laid down the concepts that would become C++;
{

~Norway
}

::Q6::What is the country is where Linux was initially implemented?
{
=Finland
~Switzerland
~The Netherlands
~Denmark
~Norway
}

::Q7::In Python what does "self" generally represent?
{
=The instance
~The class
~The entry point of the mian program
~The string representation of an object
}

::Q8::In Java, what is the concept that is equivalent to the "self"
concept in Python.
{
=this
~self-ish
~new
~__init__
}

::Q9::Which of the languages in the lecture away from being a hybrid
OO approach and towards a more "pure" OO apprach?
{
=JavaScript
~Java

~C-Sharp
}

::Q10::What is the C library routine that can be used to make a
an area of dynamically allocated memory larger?
{
=realloc()
~malloc()
~calloc()
~extend()
~exalloc()
}

::Q11::[html] What is wrong with this code segment?
<pre>
    free(thing);
    (thing->value)++;
</pre>
{
=After data is freed, it should no longer be considered valid
~Using parenthesis and then increment is only allowed for register variables
~This will only work on little-endian systems because of allocation layout
~There is no free() function, it should be wild(thing)
}


::Q1::[html]These questions come from the Guido van Rossum blog post titled,

{
=The instance dictionary
~As pickled strings
~As bit fields in a long integer
~In cookies as created by the Python "cookie cutter"
}

::Q3::Where did the initial implementation of classes in Python store method pointers?
{
=The class dictionary
~As pickled strings
~As bit fields in a long integer
