~Replicating the FORTRAN PRINT and computer GOTO language elements
}

::Q4::The C *language* has no provisions for Input/Output in the language.
Where do C developers find Input/Output capabilities when writing C?

}

::Q11::What went wrong in the late 1980's that took UNIX out of 
the running to be the universal operating system?  This action
led to the creation of a series of UNIX-like operating systems that now
dominate the market.
{
=The owners of UNIX tried to make money with it by using
restrictive licensing
~UNIX's lack of support for FORTRAN was a major barrier to adoption
~UNIX was never able to fully support the emerging TCP/IP
stack needed for ARPANET, NSFNet, and the modern Internet
~C Pointers were just too complex for the average programmer to understand.
