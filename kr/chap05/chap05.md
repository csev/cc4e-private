CHAPTER 5 POINTERS AND ARRAYS 105

A pointer is a variable that contains the address of another variable.
Pointers are very much used in C, partly because they are sometimes the
only way to express a computation, and partly because they usually lead to
more compact and efficient code than can be obtained in other ways.

Pointers have been lumped with the goto statement as a marvelous
way to create impossible-to-understand programs. This is certainly true
when they are used carelessly, and it is easy to create pointers that point
somewhere unexpected. With discipline, however, pointers can also be used
to achieve clarity and simplicity. This is the aspect that we will try to illustrate.

**5.1 Pointers and Addresses**

Since a pointer contains the address of an object, it is possible to access
the object "indirectly" through the pointer. Suppose that x is a variable,
say an int, and that px is a pointer, created in some as yet unspecified way.
The unary operator &amp; gives the _address_ of an object, so the statement

    **px =** six;

assigns the address of x to the variable **px; px** is now said to "point to" x.
The &amp; operator can be applied only to variables and array elements; constructs like &amp; (x+1 ) and &amp;3 are illegal. It is also illegal to take the address
of a **register** variable.

The unary operator \* treats its operand as the address of the ultimate
target, and accesses that address to fetch the contents. Thus if **y** is also an
    int,

**y = \*px;**

assigns to **y** the contents of whatever **px** points to. So the sequence

    **px = &x;
 y = \*px;**

assigns the same value to **y** as does

89

[comment]: <> (page 90 , 90 THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CHAPTER 5 )

**y = x;**

It is also necessary to declare the variables that participate in all of this:

    **int x, y;
 int \*px;**

The declaration of x and **y** is what we've seen all along. The declaration of
the pointer px is new.

**int \*px;**

is intended as a mnemonic; it says that the combination \*px is an int, that
is, if px occurs in the context \*px, it is equivalent to a variable of type
int. In effect, the syntax of the declaration for a variable mimics the syntax of expressions in which the variable might appear. This reasoning is
useful in all cases involving complicated declarations. For example,

    **double atof(), *dp;**

says that in an expression atof ( ) and **\*dp** have values of type double.
You should also note the implication in the declaration that a pointer is
    constrained to point to a particular kind of object.

Pointers can occur in expressions. For example, if **px** points to the
integer x, then \*px can occur in any context where x could.

**y = \*px + 1**

    sets y to 1 more than x;

    **printf("%d\n", *px)**

prints the current value of x; and
    **d = sqrt ( (double) *px)**

produces in **d** the square root of x, which is coerced into a double before

    being passed to **sqrt.** (See Chapter 2.)

In expressions like

**y = \*px + 1**

the unary operators \* and &amp; bind more tightly than arithmetic operators, so
this expression takes whatever px points at, adds 1, and assigns it to **y.** We
will return shortly to what

    y = *(px + 1)

might mean.

Pointer references can also occur on the left side of assignments. If px

points to x, then

**\*px = 0**

CHAPTER 5 POINTERS AND ARRAYS 91

sets x to zero, and

**\*px +=** 1

increments it, as does

    **(*px)++**

The parentheses are necessary in this last example; without them, the
expression would increment px instead of what it points to, because unary
operators like \* and ++ are evaluated right to left.

Finally, since pointers are variables, they can be manipulated as other
variables can. If **py** is another pointer to **int,** then

copies the contents of px into py, thus making py point to whatever px
points to.

**5.2 Pointers and Function Arguments**

Since C passes arguments to functions by "call by value," there is no
direct way for the called function to alter a variable in the calling function.
What do you do if you really have to change an ordinary argument? For
example, a sorting routine might exchange two out-of-order elements with a
function called **swap. It** is not enough to write

    **swap(a, b);**

where the swap function is defined as

    **swap(x, y)**  **/* WRONG */**

**int x, y;**

**(**

**int temp;**

**temp = x;**

**x = y;**

**y = temp;**

)

Because of call by value, **swap** _can't_ affect the arguments **a** and **b** in the
routine that called it.

Fortunately, there is a way to obtain the desired effect. The calling program passes _pointers_ to the values to be changed:

    **swap(&a, &b);**

Since the operator _&amp;_ gives the address of a variable, **&amp;a** is a pointer to **a. In**
**swap** itself, the arguments are declared to be pointers, and the actual
operands are accessed through them.

[comment]: <> (page 92 , 92 THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CHAPTER 5 )

    **swap(px, py) /* interchange *px and *py */**

**int \*px, \*py;**

**(**

**int temp;**

    **temp = *px;
     *px =** *py;
**\*py = temp;**

)

One common use of pointer arguments is in functions that must return
more than a single value. (You might say that swap returns two values, the
new values of its arguments.) As an example, consider a function **getint**
which performs free-format input conversion by breaking a stream of characters into integer values, one integer per call. **getint** has to return the
value it found, or an end of file signal when there is no more input. These
values have to be returned as separate objects, for no matter what value is
used for **EOF,** that could also be the value of an input integer.

One solution, which is based on the input function **scanf** that we will
describe in Chapter 7, is to have **getint return EOF** as its function value if
it found end of file; any other returned value signals a normal integer. The
numeric value of the integer it found is returned through an argument,
which must be a pointer to an integer. This organization separates end of
file status from numeric values.

The following loop fills an array with integers by calls to **getint:**

**int n, v, array[SIZE];**

**for (n = 0; n \&lt; SIZE &amp;&amp; getint(&amp;v) != EOF; n++)**
**array[n] = v;**

Each call sets v to the next integer found in the input. Notice that it is
essential to write &amp;v instead of v as the argument of **getint.** Using plain
v is likely to cause an addressing error, since **getint** believes it has been
handed a valid pointer.

**getint** itself is an obvious modification of the **atoi** we wrote earlier:

CHAPTER 5 POINTERS AND ARRAYS 93

    **getint(pn) /* get next integer from input */**
**int \*pn;**

**int c, sign;**

    **while ((c = getch()) == " II c == '\n' II c ==**

**/\* skip white space \*/**

**sign = 1;**

    **if (c == '+' II c == '-') ( /* record sign */**

    **sign = (c=='+') ? 1 : -1;**

    **c = getch();**

**for (\*pn = 0; c \&gt;= '0' &amp;&amp; c \&lt;= '9'; c = getch())**

**\*pn = 10 \* \*pn + c - '0';**

**\*pn \*= sign;**

    **if (c != EOF)**

    **ungetch(c);**

    **return(c);**

Throughout _ge_ t int, \*pn is used as an ordinary int variable. We have
also used getch and **ungetch** (described in Chapter 4) so the one extra
character that must be read can be pushed back onto the input.

**Exercise 5-1.** Write get f loat, the floating point analog of **getint.**
What type does get f loat return as its function value? 0

**5.3 Pointers and Arrays**

**In** C, there is a strong relationship between pointers and arrays, strong
enough that pointers and arrays really should be treated simultaneously.
Any operation which can be achieved by array subscripting can also be done
with pointers. The pointer version will in general be faster but, at least to
the uninitiated, somewhat harder to grasp immediately.

The declaration

**int a[10]**

defines an array **a** of size 10, that is a block of 10 consecutive objects named
**a [0], a [1], ..., a [9].** The notation **a [i]** means the element of the
array **i** positions from the beginning. If **pa** is a pointer to an integer,
declared as

**int \*pa**

then the assignment

**pa = &amp;a[0]**

sets **pa** to point to the zeroth element of **a;** that is, **pa** contains the address

[comment]: <> (page 94 , 94 THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CHAPTER 5 )

of a [0]. Now the assignment
x = \*pa

will copy the contents of a [0] into **x.**

If pa points to a particular element of an array a, then _by definition_
pa+1 points to the next element, and in general paâ€”i points i elements
before pa, and pa+i points i elements after. Thus, if pa points to a [01,

    * (pa-F.1 )

refers to the contents of a [1] , pa+i is the address of a [i] , and \* (pa+i)
is the contents of a [i].

These remarks are true regardless of the type of the variables in the
array a. The definition of "adding 1 to a pointer," and by extension, all
pointer arithmetic, is that the increment is scaled by the size in storage of
the object that is pointed to. Thus in pa+i, i is multiplied by the size of
the objects that pa points to before being added to pa.

The correspondence between indexing and pointer arithmetic is evidently very close. In fact, a reference to an array is converted by the compiler to a pointer to the beginning of the array. The effect is that an array
name _is_ a pointer expression. This has quite a few useful implications.
Since the name of an array is a synonym for the location of the zeroth element, the assignment

**pa = &amp;a [O]**

can also be written as
**pa = a**

Rather more surprising, at least at first sight,, is the fact that a reference
to a [ii can also be written as \* (a+i) . In evaluating a **[i], C** converts it
to \* ( a+i ) immediately; the two forms are completely equivalent. Applying
the operator &amp; to both parts of this equivalence, it follows that &amp;a [i] and
a+i are also identical: a+i is the address of the i-th element beyond a. As
the other side of this coin, if pa is a pointer, expressions may use it with a
subscript: pa [i] is identical to \* (pa+i ) **.** In short, any array and index
expression can be written as a pointer and offset, and vice versa, even in the
same statement.

There is one difference between an array name and a pointer that must
be kept in mind. A pointer is a variable, so pa=a and **pa++** are sensible
operations. But an array name is a _constant,_ not a variable: constructions
like a=pa or **a++ or p=&amp;a** are illegal.

When an array name is passed to a function, what is passed is the location of the beginning of the array. Within the called function, this argument
is a variable, just like any other variable, and so an array name argument is
truly a pointer, that is, a variable containing an address. We can use this

CHAPTER 5 POINTERS AND ARRAYS 95

fact to write a new version of **strlen,** which computes the length of a
string.

    **strlen(s) /* return length of string s */
 char \*s;**

**int n;**

    **for (n = 0; *s != '\0'; s++)**

**n++;**

    **return (n);**

Incrementing s is perfectly legal, since it is a pointer variable; s++ has no
effect on the character string in the function that called **strlen,** but merely
increments str len's private copy of the address.

As formal parameters in a function definition,

**char s[];**

and

**char \*s;**

are exactly equivalent; which one should be written is determined largely by
how expressions will be written in the function. When an array name is
passed to a function, the function can at its convenience believe that it has
been handed either an array or a pointer, and manipulate it accordingly. It
can even use both kinds of operations if it seems appropriate and clear.

It is possible to pass part of an array to a function, by passing a pointer
to the beginning of the subarray. For example, if **a** is an array,

    | and | ![](RackMultipart20210701-4-1cszrv6_html_ac7bc08f394281d0.png) |
| --- | --- |

both pass to the function **f** the address of element **a [2] ,** because **&amp;a [2]**
and **a+2** are both pointer expressions that refer to the third element of **a.**
Within **f,** the argument declaration can read

    **f(arr)**

**int arr[];**

or

[comment]: <> (page 96 , 96 THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CHAPTER 5 )

    **f (arr)
 int \*arr;**

- â€¢

So as far as **f** is concerned, the fact that the argument really refers to part of
a larger array is of no consequence.

**5.4 Address Arithmetic**

**If**  **p** is a pointer, then p++ increments **p** to point to the next element of
whatever kind of object p points to, and p+=i increments p to point i elements beyond where it currently does. These and similar constructions are
the simplest and most common forms of pointer or address arithmetic.

C is consistent and regular in its approach to address arithmetic; its
integration of pointers, arrays and address arithmetic is one of the major
strengths of the language. Let us illustrate some of its properties by writing
a rudimentary storage allocator (but useful in spite of its simplicity). There
are two routines: **alloc (n)** returns a pointer p to n consecutive character
positions, which can be used by the caller of **alloc** for storing characters;
**free (p)** releases the storage thus acquired so it can be later re-used. The
routines are "rudimentary" because the calls to **free** must be made in the
opposite order to the calls made on **alloc.** That is, the storage managed
by **alloc** and **free** is a stack, or last-in, first-out list. The standard C
library provides analogous functions which have no such restrictions, and in
Chapter 8 we will show improved versions as well. In the meantime, however, many applications really only need a trivial **alloc** to dispense little
pieces of storage of unpredictable sizes at unpredictable times.

The simplest implementation is to have **alloc** hand out pieces of a
large character array which we will call **allocbuf.** This array is private to
**alloc** and **free.** Since they deal in pointers, not array indices, no other
routine need know the name of the array, which can be declared external
**static, that** is, local to the source file containing **alloc** and **free,** and
invisible outside it. In practical implementations, the array may well not
even have a name; it might instead be obtained by asking the operating system for a pointer to some unnamed block of storage.

The other information needed is how much of **allocbuf** has been
used. We use a pointer to the next free element, called **allocp.** When
**alloc** is asked for n characters, it checks to see if there is enough room
left in **allocbuf.** If so, **alloc** returns the current value of **allocp** (i.e.,
the beginning of the free block), then increments it by **n** to point to the
next free area. **free (p) merely sets allocp to p** if p is inside
**allocbuf.**

CHAPTER 5 POINTERS AND ARRAYS 97

**#define NULL 0 /\* pointer value for error report \*/**
**#define ALLOCSIZE 1000 /\* size of available space \*/**

**static char allocbuf[ALLOCSIZE]; /\* storage for alloc \*/**
**static char \*allocp = allocbuf; /\* next free position \*/**

    **char *alloc(n) /* return pointer to n characters */**
**int n;**

    **if (allocp + n <= allocbuf + ALLOCSIZE) ( /* fits */**

**allocp += n;**

    **return(allocp - n); /* old p */**

    **) else /* not enough room */
     return (NULL);**

    **free(p) /* free storage pointed to by p */**
**char \*p;**

**if (p \&gt;= allocbuf &amp;&amp; p \&lt; allocbuf + ALLOCSIZE)**
**allocp = p;**

Some explanations. In general a pointer can be initialized just as any
other variable can, though normally the only meaningful values are NULL
(discussed below) or an expression involving addresses of previously defined
data of appropriate type. The declaration

**static char \*allocp = allocbuf;**

defines allocp to be a character pointer and initializes it to point to
allocbuf, which is the next free position when the program starts. This
could have also been written

**static char \*allocp = &amp;allocbuf[0];**

since the array name _is_ the address of the zeroth element; use whichever is

more natural.

The test

    **if (allocp + n <= allocbuf + ALLOCSIZE)**

checks if there's enough room to satisfy a request for n characters. If there
is, the new value of allocp would be at most one beyond the end of
allocbuf. If the request can be satisfied, al loc returns a normal pointer
(notice the declaration of the function itself). If not, al loc must return
some signal that no space is left. C guarantees that no pointer that validly
points at data will contain zero, so a return value of zero can be used to signal an abnormal event, in this case, no space. We write Nam, instead of

[comment]: <> (page 98 , 98 THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CHAPTER 5 )

zero, however, to indicate more clearly that this is a special value for a
pointer. In general, integers cannot meaningfully be assigned to pointers;
zero is a special case.

Tests like

    **if (allocp + n <= allocbuf + ALLOCSIZE)**

and

**if (p \&gt;= allocbuf &amp;&amp; p \&lt; allocbuf + ALLOCSIZE)**

show several important facets of pointer arithmetic. First, pointers may be
compared under certain circumstances. If p and q point to members of the
same array, then relations like \&lt;, \&gt;=, etc., work properly.

**p \&lt; q**

is true, for example, if p points to an earlier member of the array than does
q. The relations == and ! = also work. Any pointer can be meaningfully
compared for equality or inequality with **NULL.** But all bets are off if you do
arithmetic or comparisons with pointers pointing to different arrays. If
you're lucky, you'll get obvious nonsense on all machines. If you're
unlucky, your code will work on one machine but collapse mysteriously on
another.

Second, we have already observed that a pointer and an integer may be
added or subtracted. The construction

**p + n**

means the **n-th** object beyond the one p currently points to. This is true
regardless of the kind of object p is declared to point at; the compiler scales
**n** according to the size of the objects p points to, which is determined by
the declaration of **p.** For example, on the PDP-11, the scale factors are 1
for **char,** 2 for **int** and **short,** 4 for long and **float,** and 8 for
**double.**

Pointer subtraction is also valid: if p and q point to members of the
same array, **pâ€”q** is the number of elements between p and q. This fact can
be used to write yet another version of **strlen:**

    **strlen(s) /* return length of string s */
 char \*s;**

**char \*p = s;**

    **while** **(*p !=** **'MP)
 p++;**

    **return(p-s);**

In its declaration, **p** is initialized to **s,** that is, to point to the first character.

**CHAPTER 5 POINTERS AND ARRAYS**  **99**

**In the while loop, each character in turn is examined until the**  **\O**  **at the**
**end is seen. Since**  **\O**  **is zero, and since**  **while**  **tests only whether the**
**expression is zero, it is possible to omit the explicit test, and such loops are**
**often written as**

    **while (*p)**

**p++;**

**Because p points to characters, p++ advances p to the next character**
**each time, and pâ€”s gives the number of characters advanced over, that is,**
**the string length. Pointer arithmetic is consistent: if we had been dealing**
**with**  **float's,**  **which occupy more storage than**  **char's,**  **and if p were a**
**pointer to**  **float, p++**  **would advance to the next**  **float.**  **Thus we could**
**write another version of**  **alloc**  **which maintains, let us say,**  **float's**
**instead of**  **char's,**  **merely by changing**  **char**  **to**  **float**  **throughout**  **alloc**
**and**  **free.**  **All the pointer manipulations automatically take into account**
**the size of the object pointed to, so nothing else has to be altered.**

**Other than the operations mentioned here (adding or subtracting a**
**pointer and an integer; subtracting or comparing two pointers), all other**
**pointer arithmetic is illegal. It is not permitted to add two pointers, or to**
**multiply or divide or shift or mask them, or to add**  **float**  **or**  **double**  **to**
**them.**

**5.5 Character Pointers and Functions**

**A** _ **string constant,** _ **written as**

**"I am a string"**

**is an array of characters. In the internal representation, the compiler terÂ­**
**minates the array with the character \O so that programs can find the end.**
**The length in storage is thus one more than the number of characters**
**between the double quotes.**

**Perhaps the most common occurrence of string constants is as arguÂ­**
**ments to functions, as in**

    **printf("hello, world\n");**

**When a character string like this appears in a program, access to it is**
**through a character pointer; what**  **printf**  **receives is a pointer to the charÂ­**
**acter array.**

**Character arrays of course need not be function arguments. If**
**message is declared as**

**char \*message;**
**then the statement**

[comment]: <> (page 100 , 100 THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CHAPTER 5 )

**message = "now is the time";**

assigns to **message** a pointer to the actual characters. This is _not_ a string
copy; only pointers are involved. C does not provide any operators for processing an entire string of characters as a unit.

We will illustrate more aspects of pointers and arrays by studying two
useful functions from the standard I/O library to be discussed in Chapter 7.

The first function is **strcpy (s, t),** which copies the string t to the
string s. The arguments are written in this order by analogy to assignment,
where one would say

S =t

to assign **t** to **s.** The array version is first:

    **strcpy(s, t) /* copy t to s */
 char s[], t[];**

**int i;**

**i = 0;**

    **while ((s[i] = t[i]) !=**

For contrast, here is a version of **strcpy** with pointers.

**strcpy(s, t) /\* copy t to s; pointer version 1 \*/**
**char \*s, \*t;**

    **while ((*s = *t) != '\0') {**

**s++;**

**t++;**

}

Because arguments are passed by value, **strcpy** can use s and t in any
way it pleases. Here they are conveniently initialized pointers, which are
marched along the arrays a character at a time, until the \0 which terminates **t** has been copied to s.

In practice, **strcpy** would not be written as we showed it above A
second possibility might be

**strcpy(s, t) /\* copy t to s; pointer version 2 \*/**
**char \*s, \*t;**

    **while ((*s++ = *t++) != '\0')**

CHAPTER 5 POINTERS AND ARRAYS 101

This moves the increment of s and t into the test part. The value of \*t++
is the character that t pointed to before t was incremented; the postfix ++
doesn't change t until after this character has been fetched. In the same
way, the character is stored into the old s position before s is incremented.
This character is also the value that is compared against \0 to control the
loop. The net effect is that characters are copied from t to s up to and
including the terminating \ 0.

As the final abbreviation, we again observe that a comparison against \0
is redundant, so the function is often written as

**strcpy(s, t) /\* copy t to s; pointer version 3 \*/**
**char \*s, \*t;**

    **while (*s++ = *t++)**

Although this may seem cryptic at first sight, the notational convenience is
considerable, and the idiom should be mastered, if for no other reason than
that you will see it frequently in C programs.

The second routine is **strcmp (s, t) ,** which compares the character
strings s and t, and returns negative, zero or positive according as s is lexicographically less than, equal to, or greater than t. The value returned is
obtained by subtracting the characters at the first position where s and t
disagree.

**strcmp(s, t) /\* return \&lt;0 if s\&lt;t, 0 if s==t, \&gt;0 if s\&gt;t \*/**
**char s[], t[];**

**int i;**

**i = 0;**

    **while (s[i] == t[i])**

**if (s[i++] ==**

    **return (0)**

    **return(s[i] - t[i]);**

The pointer version of **strcmp:**

[comment]: <> (page 102 , 102 THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CHAPTER 5 )

**strcmp(s, t) /\* return \&lt;0 if s\&lt;t, 0 if s==t, \&gt;0 if s\&gt;t \*/**
**char \*s, \*t;**

    **for ( ; *s == *t; s++, t++)
 if (\*s ==
     return (0)**

    **return(*s â€” *t);**

Since ++ and -- are either prefix or postfix operators, other combinations of \* and ++ and -- occur, although less frequently. For example,

**\*++p**

increments p _before_ fetching the character that p points to;

**\*--p**

decrements p first.

**Exercise 5-2.** Write a pointer version of the function **strcat** which we
showed in Chapter 2: **strcat(s, t)** copies the string t to the end of s.

**Eitercise 5-3.** Write a macro for **strcpy. .**

**Exercise 5-4.** Rewrite appropriate programs from earlier chapters and exercises with pointers instead of array indexing. Good possibilities include
**getline** (Chapters **1** and **4), atoi, itoa,** and their variants (Chapters 2,
3, and **4), reverse (Chapter** 3), and **index and getop (Chapter 4).**

**5.6 Pointers are not Integers**

You may notice in older C programs a rather cavalier attitude toward
copyifig pointers. It has generally been true that on most machines a pointer
may be assigned to an integer and back again without changing it; no scaling
or conversion takes place, and no bits are lost. Regrettably, this has led to
the taking of liberties with routines that return pointers which are then
merely passed to other routines â€” the requisite pointer declarations are
often left out. For example, consider the function **strsave (s),** which
copies the string **s** into a safe place, obtained by a call on **alloc,** and
returns a pointer to it. Properly, this should be written as

CHAPTER 5 POINTERS AND ARRAYS 103

    **char *strsave(s) /* save string s somewhere */**
**char \*s;**

    **char *p, *alloc();**

    **if ((p = alloc(strlen(s)+1)) != NULL)**

    **strcpy(p, s);**

    **return(p);**

In practice, there would be a strong tendency to omit declarations:

    **strsave(s) /* save string s somewhere */**

**(**

**char \*p;**

    **if ((p = alloc(strlen(s)+1)) != NULL)**

    **strcpy(p, s);**

    **return(p);**

This will work on many machines, since the default type for functions and
arguments is int, and int and pointer can usually be safely assigned back
and forth. Nevertheless this kind of code is inherently risky, for it depends
on details of implementation and machine architecture which may not hold
for the particular compiler you use. It's wiser to be complete in all declarations. (The program _lint_ will warn of such constructions, in case they creep
in inadvertently.)

**5.7 Multi-Dimensional Arrays**

C provides for rectangular multi-dimensional arrays, although in practice
they tend to be much less used than arrays of pointers. In this section, we
will show some of their properties.

Consider the problem of date conversion, from day of the month to day
of the year and vice versa. For example, March 1 is the 60th day of a non-
leap year, and the 61st day of a leap year. Let us define two functions to do
the conversions: day\_of \_year converts the month and day into the day of
the year, and month\_day converts the day of the year into the month and
day. Since this latter function returns two values, the month and day arguments will be pointers:

    **month\_day(1977, 60, &m, &d)**

sets m to 3 and **d** to 1 (March 1st).

These functions both need the same information, a table of the number
of days in each month ("thirty days hath September ..."). Since the
number of days per month differs for leap years and non-leap years, it's

[comment]: <> (page 104 , 104 THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CHAPTER 5 )

easier to separate them into two rows of a two-dimensional array than try to
keep track of what happens to February during computation. The array and
the functions for performing the transformations are as follows:

| **static int day\_tab[2][13]** | **=(** |
 |
 |
 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **(0, 31, 28, 31, 30,** | **31,** | **30,** | **31, 31, 30, 31, 30,** | **31),** |
| **(0, 31, 29, 31, 30,** | **31,** | **30,** | **31, 31, 30, 31, 30,** | **31)** |
| ); |
 |
 |
 |
 |
| **day\_of\_year(year, month,** | **day)** | **/\*** | **set day of year \*/** |
 |
| **int year, month, day;** |
 | **/\*** | **from month &amp; day \*/** |
 |

**int i, leap;**

**leap = year%4 == 0 &amp;&amp; year%100 != 0 II year%400 == 0;**

    **for (i = 1; i < month; i++)**

**day += day\_tab[leap][i];**

    **return (day);**

**month\_day(year, yearday, pmonth, pday) /\* set month, day \*/**
**int year, yearday, \*pmonth, \*pday; /\* from day of year \*/**

**int i, leap;**

**leap = year%4 == 0 &amp;&amp; year%100 != 0 II year%400 == 0;**

**for (i = 1; yearday \&gt; day\_tab[leap][i]; i++)**

**yearday -= day\_tab[leap][i];**

**\*pmonth =**

**\*pday = yearday;**

The array **day\_tab** has to be external to both **day\_of\_year** and
**month\_day,** so they can both use it.

**day\_tab** is the first two-dimensional array we have dealt with. In C,
by definition a two-dimensional array is really a one-dimensional array, each
of whose elements is an array. Hence subscripts are written as

**day\_tab[i]** [j]
 rather than

**day\_tab[i, j]**

as in most languages. Other than this, a two-dimensional array can be
treated in much the same way as in other languages. Elements are stored by
rows, that is, the rightmost subscript varies fastest as elements are accessed
in storage order.

CHAPTER 5 POINTERS AND ARRAYS 105

An array is initialized by a list of initializers in braces; each row of a
two-dimensional array is initialized by a corresponding sub-list. We started
the array day\_tab with a column of zero so that month numbers can run
from the natural 1 to 12 instead of 0 to 11. Since space is not at a premium
here, this is easier than adjusting indices.

If a two-dimensional array is to be passed to a function, the argument
declaration in the function _must_ include the column dimension; the row
dimension is irrelevant, since what is passed is, as before, a pointer. In this
particular case, it is a pointer to objects which are arrays of 13 it's. Thus
if the array day\_tab is to be passed to a function f, the declaration of f
would be

    **f (day\_tab)**

**int day\_tab [2] [1 3] ;**

- â€¢ â€¢

The argument declaration in f could also be

**int day\_tab [1 [1 3] ;**

since the number of rows is irrelevant, or it could be

    **int (*day\_tab) [1 3] ;**

-which says that the argument is a pointer to an array of 13 integers. The
    parentheses are necessary since brackets [] have higher precedence than *;
without parentheses, the declaration

**int \*day\_tab [1 3] ;**

is an array of 13 pointers to integers, as we shall see in the next section.
**5.8 Pointer Arrays; Pointers to Pointers**

Since pointers are variables themselves, you might expect that there
would be uses for arrays of pointers. This is indeed the case. Let us illustrate by writing a program that will sort a set of text lines into alphabetic
order, a stripped-down version of the UNIX utility _sort._

In Chapter 3 we presented a Shell sort function that would sort an array
of integers. The same algorithm will work, except that now we have to deal
with lines of text, which are of different lengths, and which, unlike integers,
can't be compared or moved in a single operation. We need a data
representation that will cope efficiently and conveniently with variable-length
text lines.

This is where the array of pointers enters. If the lines to be sorted are
stored end-to-end in one long character array (maintained by **alloc,**
perhaps), then each line can be accessed by a pointer to its first character.

[comment]: <> (page 106 , 106 THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CHAPTER 5 )

The pointers themselves can be stored in an array. Two lines can be compared by passing their pointers to strcmp. When two out-of-order lines
have to be exchanged, the _pointers_ in the pointer array are exchanged, not
the text lines themselves. This eliminates the twin problems of complicated
storage management and high overhead that would go with moving the
â€ž actual lines.

\ The sorting process involves three steps:

_read all the lines of input_

_sort them_

_print them in order_

As usual, it's best to divide the program into functions that match this
natural division, with the main routine controlling things.

Let us defer the sorting step for a moment, and concentrate on the data
structure and the input and output. The input routine has to collect and
save the characters of each line, and build an array of pointers to the lines.
It will also have to count the number of input lines, since that information
is needed for sorting and printing. Since the input function can only cope
with a finite number of input lines, it can return some illegal line count like
â€”1 if too much input is presented. The output routine only has to print the
lines in the order in which they appear in the array of pointers.

**#define NULL 0**

**#define LINES 100 /\* max lines to be sorted \*/**

    **main() /* sort input lines */**

**char \*lineptr[LINES]; /\* pointers to text lines \*/**

**int nlines; /\* number of input lines read \*/**

    **if ((nlines = readlines(lineptr, LINES)) >= 0) (**

    **sort(lineptr, nlines);**

    **writelines(lineptr, nlines);**

**else**

    **printf("input too big to sort\n");**

**CHAPTER 5 POINTERS AND ARRAYS**  **107**

**#define MAXLEN 1000**

    **readlines(lineptr, maxlines) /* read input lines */**

**char \*lineptr[]; /\* for sorting \*/**

**int maxlines;**

**(**

**int len, nlines;**

    **char *p, *alloc(), line[MAXLEN];**

**nlines = 0;**

    **while ((len = getline(line, MAXLEN)) > 0)**

    **if (nlines >= maxlines)**

    **return(-1);**

    **else if ((p = alloc(len)) == NULL)**

    **return(-1);**

**else (**

**line[len-1] = '\0'; /\* zap newline \*/**

    **strcpy(p, line);**

**lineptr[nlines++] = p;**

**}**

    ![](RackMultipart20210701-4-1cszrv6_html_37d52289e98675a1.gif)

    **return (nlines);**

**)**

**The newline at the end of each line is deleted so it will not affect the c**
**in which the lines are sorted.**

    **writelines(lineptr, nlines) /* write output lines */**

**char \*lineptr[];**

**int nlines;**

**(**

**int i;**

    **for (i = 0; i < nlines; i++)
     printf("%s\n", lineptr[i]);**

)

**The main new thing is the declaration for**  **lineptr:**
**char \*lineptr [LINES];**

**says that**  **lineptr**  **is an array of**  **LINES**  **elements, each element of which is**
**a pointer to a**  **char.**  **That is,**  **lineptr NJ**  **is a character pointer, and**
**\*lineptr** **[i]**  **accesses a character.**

**Since**  **lineptr**  **is itself an array which is passed to**  **writelines,**  **it**
**can be treated as a pointer in exactly the same manner as our earlier examÂ­**
**ples, and the function can be written instead as**

[comment]: <> (page 5 , **108** THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CHAPTER 5 )

    **writelines(lineptr, nlines) /* write output lines */**

**char \*lineptr[];**

**int nlines;**

    **while (--nlines >= 0)**

    **printf("%s\n", *lineptr++);**

**\*lineptr** points initially to the first line; each increment advances it to the
next line while **nlines** is counted down.

With input and output under control, we can proceed to sorting. The
Shell sort from Chapter 3 needs minor changes: the declarations have to be
modified, and the comparison operation must be moved into a separate
function. The basic algorithm remains the same, which gives us some
confidence that it will still work.

**sort(v, n) /\* sort strings v[0] v[n-1] \*/**

**char \*v[]; /\* into increasing order \*/**
**int n;**

    **int gap, i, j;
 char \*temp;**

**for (gap = n/2; gap \&gt; 0; gap /= 2)**

    **for (i = gap; i < n; i++)**

**for (j = i-gap; j \&gt;= 0; j -= gap) (**

**if (strcmp(v[j], v[j+gap]) \&lt;= 0)**

**break;**

**temp = v[j];**

**v[j] = v[j+gap];**

**v[j+gap] = temp;**

Since any individual element of v (alias **lineptr)** is a character pointer,
**temp** also should be, so one can be copied to the other.

We wrote the program about as straightforwardly as possible, so as to
get it working quickly. It might be faster, for instance, to copy the incoming
lines directly into an array maintained by **readlines,** rather than copying
them into **line** and then to a hidden place maintained by a 1 loc. But it's
wiser to make the first draft something easy to understand, and worry about
"efficiency" later. The way to make this program significantly faster is
probably not by avoiding an unnecessary copy of the input lines. Replacing
the Shell sort by something better, like Quicksort, is more likely to make a
difference.

In Chapter 1 we pointed out that because **while and for loops test the**
**termination condition** _before_ executing the loop body even once, they help

CHAPTER 5 POINTERS AND ARRAYS 109

to ensure that programs will work at their boundaries, in particular with no
input. It is illuminating to walk through the functions of the sorting program, checking what happens if there is no input text at all.

**Exercise 5-5.** Rewrite **readlines** to create lines in an array supplied by
**main,** rather than calling **anoc** to maintain storage. How much faster is
the program? o

**5.9 Initialization of Pointer Arrays**

Consider the problem of writing a function **month\_name** (n) , which
returns a pointer to a character string containing the name of the n-th
month. This is an ideal application for an internal **static** array.
**month\_name** contains a private array of character strings, and returns a
pointer to the proper one when called. The topic of this section is how that
array of names is initialized.

The syntax is quite similar to previous initializations:

**char \*month\_name(n) /\* return name of n-th month \*/**
**int n;**

**static char \*namell =(
 "illegal month",
 "January",**

**"February",**

**"March",**

**"April",**

**"June",**

**"July",**

**"August",**

**"September",
 "October",
 "November",
 "December"**

    ) ;

**return((n \&lt; 1 II n \&gt; 12) ? name [01 : name[n]);**

The declaration of **name,** which is an array of character pointers, is the same
as **lineptr** in the sorting example. The initializer is simply a list of character strings; each is assigned to the corresponding position in the array.
More precisely, the characters of the i-th string are placed somewhere else,
and-a pointer to them is stored in **name [ii.** Since the size of the array
**name** is not specified, the compiler itself counts the initializers and fills in
the correct number.

[comment]: <> (page 110 , 110 THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CHAPTER 5 )

**5.10 Pointers vs. Multi-dimensional Arrays**

Newcomers to C are sometimes confused about the difference between a
two-dimensional array and an array of pointers, such as **name** in the example above. Given the declarations

    **int a [1 0] [1 0] ;
 int \*b **** [1 0] ;**

the usage of **a** and **b** may be similar, in that **a [5] [5]** and **b [5] [5]** are
both legal references to a single **int.** But **a** is a true array: all 100 storage
cells have been allocated, and the conventional rectangular subscript calculation is done to find any given element. For **b,** however, the declaration
only allocates 10 pointers; each must be set to point to an array of integers.
Assuming that each does point to a ten-element array, then there will be
100 storage cells set aside, plus the ten cells for the pointers. Thus the array
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
of pointers uses slightly more space, and may require an explicit initialization step. But it has two advantages: accessing an element is done by
indirection through a pointer rather than by a multiplication and an addition,
and the rows of the array may be of different lengths. That is, each element
of b need not point to a ten-element vector; some may point to two elements, some to twenty, and some to none at all.

Although we have phrased this discussion in terms of integers, by far
the most frequent use of arrays of pointers is like that shown in
**month\_name:** to store character strings of diverse lengths.

**Exercise 5-6.** Rewrite the routines day\_of \_year and month\_day with
pointers instead of indexing. D

**5.11 Command-line Arguments**

In environments that support C, there is a way to pass command-line
arguments or parameters to a program when it begins executing. When
**main** is called to begin execution, it is called with two arguments. The first
(conventionally called **argc)** is the number of command-line arguments the
program was invoked with; the second **(argv)** is a pointer to an array of
    character strings that contain the arguments, one per string. Manipulating
these character strings is a common use of multiple levels of pointers.

The simplest illustration of the necessary declarations and use is the program echo, which simply echoes its command-line arguments on a single
line, separated by blanks. That is, if the command

**echo hello, world**
is given, the output is
**hello, world**

CHAPTER 5 POINTERS AND ARRAYS 111

**By convention, argv [0] is the name by which the program was invoked,**
**so argc is at least 1. In the example above, argc is 3, and argv [01,**
**argv [1] and argv [2] are "echo", "he llo , ", and "world" respecÂ­**
**tively. The first real argument is argv [1] and the last is argv [argc-1] .**
**If argc is 1, there are no command-line arguments after the program name.**
**This is shown in**  **echo:**

    **main(argc, argv) /* echo arguments; 1st version */**

**int argc;**

**char \*argv[];**

**int i;**

    **for (i = 1; i < argc; i++)**

**printf("%s%c", argv[i], (i\&lt;argc-1) ? : '\n');**

**Since argv is a pointer to an array of pointers, there are several ways to**
**write this program that involve manipulating the pointer rather than indexÂ­**
**ing an array. Let us show two variations.**

    **main(argc, argv) /* echo arguments; 2nd version */**

**int argc;**

**char \*argv[];**

    **while (--argc > 0)**

    **printf("%s%c", *++argv, (argc > 1) ?** : **'\n');**

**Since argv** is a **pointer** to the **beginning of the array of argument strings,**
**incrementing** it by 1 **(++argv) makes** it **point at the original argv [1**
**instead of argv [0] . Each successive increment moves it along to the next**
**argument; \*argv is then the pointer** to that **argument.** _At_ the same time,
**argc is decremented;** when **it becomes zero, there are no arguments left to**
**print.**

**Alternatively,**

    **main(argc, argv) /* echo arguments; 3rd version */**

**int argc;**

**char \*argil[];**

    **while (--argc > 0)**

    **printf((argc > 1) ? "%s " : "%s\n", *++argv);**

**This version shows that the format argument of**  **printf**  **can be an expresÂ­**
**sion just like any of the others. This usage is not very frequent, but worth**
**remembering.**

[comment]: <> (page 112 , 112 THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CHAPTER 5 )

As a second example, let us make some enhancements to the pattern-
finding program from Chapter 4. If you recall, we wired the search pattern
deep into the program, an obviously unsatisfactory arrangement. Following
the lead of the UNIX utility _grep,_ let us change the program so the pattern to
be matched is specified by the first argument on the command line.

**#define MAXLINE 1000**

    **main(argc, argv) /* find pattern from first argument */**

**int argc;**

**char \*argv[];**

**char line[MAXLINE];**

    **if (argc != 2)**

    **printf("Usage: find pattern\n");**
**else**

    **while (getline(line, MAXLINE) > 0)**
    **if (index(line, argv[1]) >= 0)**
    **printf("%su, line);**

The basic model can now be elaborated to illustrate further pointer constructions. Suppose we want to allow two optional arguments. One says
"print all lines _except_ those that match the pattern;" the second says "precede each printed line with its line number."

A common convention for C programs is that an argument beginning
with a minus sign introduces an optional flag or parameter. If we choose **â€”**** x**
(for "except") to signal the inversion, and â€”n ("number") to request line
numbering, then the command

**find -x -n the**
with the input

now is the time
 for all good men
 to come to the aid
 of their party.

should produce the output
2: for all good men

Optional arguments should be permitted in any order, and the rest of
the program should be insensitive to the number of arguments which were
actually present. In particular, the call to **index** should not refer to
**argv [21** when there was a single flag argument and to **argv [11** when
there wasn't. Furthermore, it is convenient for users if option arguments

CHAPTER 5 POINTERS AND ARRAYS **113**

**can be concatenated, as in**

**find -nx the**

**Here is the program.**

**#define MAXLINE 1000**

    **main(argc, argv) /* find pattern from first argument */**

**int argc;**

**char \*argv[];**

**(**

**char line[MAXLINE], \*s;**

**long lineno = 0;**

**int except = 0, number = 0;**

    **while (--argc > 0 && (*++argv)[0] == '-')**

    **for (s = argv[0]+1; *s != '\0'; s++)**

    **switch (*s) (**

**case 'x':**

**except = 1;**

**break;**

**case 'n':**

**number = 1;**

**break;**

**default:**

    **printf("find: illegal option %c\n", *s);**

**argc = 0;**

**break;**

**)**

    **if (argc != 1)**

    **printf("Usage: find -x -n pattern\n");**

**else**

    **while (getline(line, MAXLINE) > 0) (**

**lineno++;**

    **if ((index(line, *argv) >= 0) != except) (**

    **if (number)**

    **printf("%ld: ", lineno);**

    **printf("%s", line);**

1

)

)

**argv is incremented before each optional argument, and argc decre-**
**mented. If there are no errors, at the end of the loop argc should be 1 and**
**\*argv should point at the pattern. Notice that \*-1-+argy is a pointer to an**
**argument string; (\*++argv) [0] is its first character. The parentheses are**
**necessary, for without them the expression would be \*++ (argv [0] ) ,**
**which is quite different (and wrong). An alternate valid form would be**

[comment]: <> (page 114 , 114 THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CHAPTER 5 )

**\*\*++argv.**

**Exercise 5-7.** Write the program **add** which evaluates a reverse Polish
expression from the command line. For example,

**add 2 3 4 +**

    evaluates 2 x (3**+4). o**

**Exercise 5-8.** Modify the programs **entab** and **detab** (written as exercises
in Chapter 1) to accept a list of tab stops as arguments. Use the normal tab
settings if there are no arguments. o

**Exercise 5-9.** Extend **entab** and **detab** to accept the shorthand
**entab** _m +n_

to mean tabs stops every _n_ columns, starting at column _m._ Choose convenient (for the user) default behavior. 0

**Exercise 5-10.** Write the program **tail,** which prints the last _n_ lines of its
input. By default, _n is_ 10, let us say, but it can be changed by an optional
argument, so that

_tail_ _-n_

prints the last _n_ lines. The program should behave rationally no matter how
unreasonable the input or the value of _n._ Write the program so it makes
the best use of available storage: lines should be stored as in **sort,** not in a
two-dimensional array of fixed size.

**5.12 Pointers to Functions**

In C, a function itself is not a variable, but it is possible to define a
_pointer to a function,_ which can be manipulated, passed to functions, placed
in arrays, and so on. We will illustrate this by modifying the sorting procedure written earlier in this chapter so that if the optional argument â€”n is
given, it will sort the input lines numerically instead of lexicographically.

A sort often consists of three parts â€” a _comparison_ which determines
the ordering of any pair of objects, an _exchange_ which reverses their order,
and a _sorting algorithm_ which makes comparisons and exchanges until the
objects are in order. The sorting algorithm is independent of the comparison and exchange operations, so by passing different comparison and
exchange functions to it, we can arrange to sort by different criteria. This is
the approach taken in our new sort.

The lexicographic comparison of two lines is done by **strcmp** and swapping by **swap** as before; we will also need a routine **numcmp** which compares two lines on the basis of numeric value and returns the same kind of
condition indication as **strcmp** does. These three functions are declared in

**CHAPTER 5 POINTERS AND ARRAYS**  **115**

**main and pointers to them are passed to sort. sort in turn calls the**
**functions via the pointers. We have skimped on error processing for arguÂ­**
**ments, so as to concentrate on the main issues.**

**#define LINES 100 /\* max number of lines to be sorted \*/**

    **main(argc, argv) /* sort input lines */**

**int argc;**

**char \*argv[];**

**char \*lineptr[LINES]; /\* pointers to text lines \*/**

**int nlines; /\* number of input lines read \*/**
    **int strcmp(), numcmp(); /* comparison functions */**

    **int swap(); /* exchange function */**

**int numeric = 0; /\* 1 if numeric sort \*/**

**if (argc\&gt;1 &amp;&amp; argv[1][0] == &amp;&amp; argv[1][1] == 'n')**

**numeric = 1;**

    **if ((nlines = readlines(lineptr, LINES)) >= 0) (**

    **if (numeric)**

    **sort(lineptr, nlines, numcmp, swap);**

**else**

    **sort(lineptr, nlines, strcmp, swap);**

    **writelines(lineptr, nlines);**

**) else**

    **printf("input too big to sort\n");**

**strcmp, numcmp and swap are addresses of functions; since they are**
**known to be functions, the &amp; operator is not necessary, in the same way that**
**it is not needed before an array name. The compiler arranges for the**
**address of the function to be passed.**

**The second step is to modify sort:**

[comment]: <> (page 116 , 116 THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CHAPTER 5 )

**sort(v, n****) **** comp, exch) /\* sort strings v[0]...v[n-1] \*/**

**char \*v[]; /\* into increasing order \*/**

**int n;**

    **int (*comp)(), (*exch)();**

**(**

**int gap, i, j;**

**for (gap = n/2; gap \&gt; 0; gap 1= 2)**

    **for (i = gap; i < n; i++)**

**for (j = i-gap; j \&gt;= 0; j -=** **gap)** **(**

**if ((\*comp)(v[j], v[j+gap]) \&lt;= 0)**

**break;**

    **(*exch)(&v[j], &v[j+gapp;**

)

)

The declarations should be studied with some care.

    **int (*comp)** ( )

says that comp is a pointer to a function that returns an int. The first set
of parentheses are necessary; without them,

    **int *comp()**

would say that comp is a function returning a pointer to an int, which is

quite a different thing.

The use of comp in the line

**if ((\*comp)(v[j], v[j+gap]) \&lt;= 0)**

is consistent with the declaration: comp is a pointer to a function, \*comp is
the function, and

    **(*comp)(v[j], v[j+gap])**

is the call to it. The parentheses are needed so the components are correctly
associated.

We have already shown **strcmp,** which compares two strings. Here is
numcmp, which compares two strings on a leading numeric value:

**CHAPTER 5 POINTERS AND ARRAYS** 117

    **numcmp(s1, s2) /* compare s1 and s2 numerically */**
**char \*s1, \*s2;**

    **double atof(), v1, v2;**

    **v1 = atof(s1);**

    **v2 = atof(s2);
     if (v1 < v2)**

    **return(-1);**

    **else if (v1 > v2)
     return(1);
 else**

    **return(0);**

The final step is to add the function **swap** which exchanges two
pointers. This is adapted directly from what we presented early in the
chapter.

    **swap(px, py) /* interchange *px and *py */**
    **char *px(), *py[];**

**char \*temp;**

    **temp = *px;
     *px = *py;
 \*py = temp;**

There are a variety of other options that can be added to the sorting program; some make challenging exercises.

**Exercise 5-11.** Modify **sort to handle a â€”r** flag, which indicates sorting in
reverse (decreasing) order. Of course **â€”r must work with â€”n.**

**Exercise 5-12. Add the option â€”**** f** to fold upper and lower case together, so
that case distinctions are not made during sorting: upper and lower case data
are sorted together, so that **a and**  **A** appear adjacent, not separated by an
entire case of the alphabet. 0

**Exercise 5-13. Add the â€”**** d** ("dictionary order") option, which makes comparisons only on letters, numbers and blanks. Make sure it works in conjunction with **â€”**** f. 0**

**Exercise 5-14.** Add a field-handling capability, so sorting may be done on
fields within lines, each field according to an independent set of options.
(The index for this book was sorted with **â€”**** df **** for the index category and â€”n**
**for the page numbers.)**
