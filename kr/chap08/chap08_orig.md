CHAPTER 8: THE UNIX SYSTEM INTERFACE

The material in this chapter is concerned with the interface between C
programs and the UNIXt operating system. Since most C users are on UNIX
systems, this should be helpful to a majority of readers. Even if you use C
on a different machine, however, you should be able to glean more insight
into C programming from studying these examples.

The chapter is divided into three major areas: input/output, file system,
and a storage allocator. The first two parts assume a modest familiarity with
the external characteristics of UNIX.

Chapter 7 was concerned with a system interface that is uniform across a
variety of operating systems. On any particular system the routines of the
standard library have to be written in terms of the I/O facilities actually
available on the host system. In the next few sections we will describe the
basic system entry points for I/O on the UNIX operating system, and illus­
trate how parts of the standard library can be implemented with them.

8.1 File Descriptors

In the UNIX operating system, all input and output is done by reading or
writing files, because all peripheral devices, even the user&#39;s terminal, are
files in the file system. This means that a single, homogeneous interface
handles all communication between a program and peripheral devices.

In the most general case, before reading or writing a file, it is necessary
to inform the system of your intent to do so, a process called &quot;opening&quot; the
file. If you are going to write on a file it may also be necessary to create it.
The system checks your right to do so (Does the file exist? Do you have
permission to access it?), and if all is well, returns to the program a small
positive integer called a _file descriPtor._ Whenever I/O is to be done on the
file, the file descriptor is used instead of the name to identify the file. (This
is roughly analogous to the use of READ(5,...) and WRITE(6,...) in Fortran.)
All information about an open file is maintained by the system; the user

159

160 THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CHAPTER 8

program refers to the file only by the file descriptor.

Since input and output involving the user&#39;s terminal is so common, spe­
cial arrangements exist to make this convenient. When the command inter­
preter (the &quot;shell&quot;) runs a program, it opens three files, with file descriptors
0, 1, and 2, called the standard input, the standard output, and the standard
error output. All of these are normally connected to the terminal, so if a
program reads file descriptor 0 and writes file descriptors 1 and 2, it can do
terminal I/O without worrying about opening the files.

The user of a program can _redirect_ I/O to and from files with \&lt; and \&gt;:

prog \&lt;infile \&gt;outfile

In this case, the shell changes the default assignments for file descriptors 0
and 1 from the terminal to the named files. Normally file descriptor 2
remains attached to the terminal, so error messages can go there. Similar
observations hold if the input or output is associated with a pipe. In all
cases, it must be noted, the file assignments are changed by the shell, not by
the program. The program does not know where its input comes from nor
where its output goes, so long as it uses file 0 for input and 1 and 2 for out­
put.

8.2 Low Level I/O — Read and Write

The lowest level of I/O in UNIX provides no buffering or any other ser­
vices; it is in fact a direct entry into the operating system. All input and
output is done by two functions called read and write. For both, the first
argument is a file descriptor. The second argument is a buffer in your pro­
gram where the data is to come from or go to. The third argument is the
number of bytes to be transferred. The calls are

n\_read = read(fd, buf, n);
 n\_written = write(fd, buf, n);

Each call returns a byte count which is the number of bytes actually
transferred. On reading, the number of bytes returned may be less than the
number asked for. A return value of zero bytes implies end of file, and —1
indicates an error of some sort. For writing, the returned value is the
number of bytes actually written; it is generally an error if this isn&#39;t equal to
the number supposed to be written.

The number of bytes to be read or written is quite arbitrary. The two
most common values are 1, which means one character at a time
(&quot;unbuffered&quot;), and 512, which corresponds to a physical blocksize on
many peripheral devices. This latter size will be most efficient, but even
character at a time I/O is not inordinately expensive.

CHAPTER 8 THE UNIX SYSTEM INTERFACE 161

Putting these facts together, we can write a simple program to copy its
input to its output, the equivalent of the file copying program written for
Chapter 1. In UNIX, this program will copy anything to anything, since the
input and output can be redirected to any file or device.

#define BUFSIZE 512 /\* best size for PDP-11 UNIX \*/

main() /\* copy input to output \*/

char buf[BUFSIZE];
 jilt n;

while ((n = read(0, buf, BUFSIZE)) \&gt; 0)
write(1, buf, n);

If the file size is not a multiple of BUFSIZE, some read will return a
smaller number of bytes to be written by write; the next call to read after
that will return zero.

It is instructive to see how read and write can be used to construct
higher level routines like getchar, putchar, etc. For example, here is a
version of getchar which does unbuffered input.

#define CMASK 0377 /\* for making char&#39;s \&gt; 0 \*/
getchar() /\* unbuffered single character input \*/

char c;

return((read(0, &amp;c, 1) \&gt; 0) ? c &amp; CMASK : Eor);

c _must_ be declared char, because read accepts a character pointer. The
character being returned must be masked with 0377 to ensure that it is
positive; otherwise sign extension may make it negative. (The constant
0377 is appropriate for the PDP-11 but not necessarily for other machines.)

The second version of getchar does input in big chunks, and hands
out the characters one at a time.

162 THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CHAPTER 8

#define CMASK 0377 /\* for making char&#39;s \&gt; 0 \*/
#define BUFSIZE 512

getchar() /\* buffered version \*/

static char buf [BUFSIZE];

static char \*bufp = buf;

static int n = 0;

if (n == 0) ( /\* buffer is empty \*/

n = read(0, buf, BUFSIZE);

bufp = buf;

return((--n \&gt;= 0) ? \*bufp++ &amp; CMASK : EOF);

8.3 Open, Creat, Close, Unlink

Other than the default standard input, output and error files, you must
explicitly open files in order to read or write them. There are two system
entry points for this, open and creat [sic].

open is rather like the fopen discussed in Chapter 7, except that
instead of returning a file pointer, it returns a file descriptor, which is just an
int.

int fd;

fd = open(name, rwmode);

As with fopen, the name argument is a character string corresponding to
the external file name. The access mode argument is different, however:
rwmode is 0 for read, 1 for write, and 2 for read and write access. open
returns —1 if any error occurs; otherwise it returns a valid file descriptor.

It is an error to try to open a file that does not exist. The entry point
creat is provided to create new files, or to re-write old ones.

fd = creat(name, pmode);

returns a file descriptor if it was able to create the file called name, and —1
if not. If the file already exists, creat will truncate it to zero length; it is
not an error to creat a file that already exists.

If the file is brand new, creat creates it with the _protection mode_
specified by the pmode argument. In the UNIX file system, there are nine
bits of protection information associated with a file, controlling read, write
and execute permission for the owner of the file, for the owner&#39;s group, and
for all others. Thus a three-digit octal number is most convenient for speci­
fying the permissions. For example, 0755 specifies read, write and execute

CHAPTER 8 THE UNIX SYSTEM INTERFACE 163

permission for the owner, and read and execute permission for the group
and everyone else.

To illustrate, here is a simplified version of the UNIX utility _cp,_ a pro­
gram which copies one file to another. (The main simplification is that our
version copies only one file, and does not permit the second argument to be
a directory.)

#define NULL 0

#define BUFSIZE 512

#define PMODE 0644 /\* RW for owner, R for group, others \*/

main(argc, argv) /\* cp: copy f1 to f2 \*/

int argc;

char \*argv[];

int f1, f2, n;
 char buf [BUFSIZE];

if (argc != 3)

error(&quot;Usage: cp from to&quot;, NULL);
if ((f1 = open(argv[1], 0)) == -1)

error(&quot;cp: can&#39;t open %s&quot;, argv[1]);
if ((f2 = creat(argv[2], PMODE)) == -1)
error(&quot;cp: can&#39;t create %s&quot;, argv[2]);

while ((n = read(f1, buf, BUFSIZE)) \&gt; 0)
if (write(f2, buf, n) != n)

error(&quot;cp: write error&quot;, NULL);

exit (0)

error(s1, s2) /\* print error message and die \*/
char \*s1, \*s2;

printf(s1, s2);
 printf(&quot;\n&quot;);
 exit(1);

There is a limit (typically 15-25) on the number of files which a program
may have open simultaneously. Accordingly, any program which intends to
process many files must be prepared to re-use file descriptors. The routine
close breaks the connection between a file descriptor and an open file, and
frees the file descriptor for use with some other file. Termination of a pro­
gram via exit or return from the main program closes all open files.

The function unlink ( f ilename ) removes the file filename from
the file system.

write, open and close instead of their standard library equivalents. Per­
form experiments to determine the relative speeds of the two versions. El

8.4 Random Access — Seek and Lseek

File I/0 is normally sequential: each read or write takes place at a
position in the file right after the previous one. When necessary, however,
a file can be read or written in any arbitrary order. The system call lseek
provides a way to move around in a file without actually reading or writing:

lseek(fd, offset, origin);

forces the current position in the file whose descriptor is fd to move to
position offset, which is taken relative to the location specified by
origin. Subsequent reading or writing will begin at that position.
offset is a long; fd and origin are it&#39;s. origin can be 0, 1, or 2
to specify that offset is to be measured from the beginning, from the
current position, or from the end of the file respectively. For example, to
append to a file, seek to the end before writing:

lseek(fd, OL, 2);

To get back to the beginning (&quot;rewind&quot;),

lseek(fd, OL, 0);

Notice the OL argument; it could also be written as (long) 0.

With lseek, it is possible to treat files more or less like large arrays, at
the price of slower access. For example, the following simple function reads
any number of bytes from any arbitrary place in a file.

get(fd, pos, buf, n) /\* read n bytes from position pos \*/

int fd, n;

long pos;

char \*buf;

(

lseek(fd, pos, 0); /\* get to pos \*/

return(read(fd, buf, n));

)

In pre-version 7 UNIX, the basic entry point to the I/O system is called
seek. seek is identical to lseek, except that its offset argument is an
int rather than a long. Accordingly, since PDP-11 integers have only 16
bits, the offset specified for seek is limited to 65,535; for this reason,
origin values of 3, 4, 5 cause seek to multiply the given offset by 512
(the number of bytes in one physical block) and then interpret origin as if
it were 0, 1, or 2 respectively. Thus to get to an arbitrary place in a large
file requires two seeks, first one which selects the block, then one which has

CHAPTER 8 THE UNIX SYSTEM INTERFACE 165

origin equal to 1 and moves to the desired byte within the block.

Exercise 8-2. Clearly, seek can be written in terms of lseek, and vice
versa. Write each in terms of the other. 0

8.5 Example — An Implementation of Fopen and Getc

Let us illustrate how some of these pieces fit together by showing an
implementation of the standard library routines fopen and getc.

Recall that files in the standard library are described by file pointers
rather than file descriptors. A file pointer is a pointer to a structure that
contains several pieces of information about the file: a pointer to a buffer, so
the file can be read in large chunks; a count of the number of characters left
in the buffer; a pointer to the next character position in the buffer; some
flags describing read/write mode, etc.; and the file descriptor.

The data structure that describes a file is contained in the file stdio.h,
which must be included (by #include) in any source file that uses rou­
tines from the standard library. It is also included by functions in that
library. In the following excerpt from stdio.h, names which are intended
for use only by functions of the library begin with an underscore so they are
less likely to collide with names in a user&#39;s program.

#define \_BUFSIZE 512

#define \_NFILE 20 /\* #files that can be handled \*/

typedef struct \_iobuf (

**char \*\_ptr; /\* next character position \*/**

**int \_cnt; /\* number of characters left \*/**

**char \*\_base; /\* location of buffer \*/**

**int \_flag; /\* mode of file access \*/**

**int \_fd; /\* file descriptor \*/**

**) FILE;**

**extern FILE \_iob[\_NFILE];**

#define stdin (&amp;\_iob[0])
 #define stdout (&amp;\_iob[1])
 #define stderr (&amp;\_iob[2])

#define \_READ 01 /\* file open for reading \*/

#define \_WRITE 02 /\* file open for writing \*/

#define \_UNBUF 04 /\* file is unbuffered \*/

#define \_BIGBUF 010 /\* big buffer allocated \*/
#define \_EOF 020 /\* EOF has occurred on this file \*/
#define \_ERR 040 /\* error has occurred on this file \*/
#define NULL 0

#define EOF (-1)

166 THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CHAPTER 8

#define getc(p) (--(p)-\&gt;\_cnt \&gt;= 0 \

? \*(p)-\&gt;\_ptr++ &amp; 0377 : \_fillbuf(p))

#define getchar() getc(stdin)

#define putc(x,p) (--(p)-\&gt;\_cnt \&gt;= 0 \

? \*(p)-\&gt;\_ptr++ = (x) : \_flushbuf((x),p))

#define putchar(x) putc(x,stdout)

The getc macro normally just decrements the count, advances the
pointer, and returns the character. (A long #define is continued with a
backslash.) If the count goes negative, however, getc calls the function
\_fillbuf to replenish the buffer, re-initialize the structure contents, and
return a character. A function may present a portable interface, yet itself
contain non-portable constructs: getc masks the character with 0377,
which defeats the sign extension done by the PDP-11 and ensures that all
characters will be positive.

Although we will not discuss any details, we have included the definition
of putc to show that it operates in much the same way as getc, calling a
function \_f lushbuf when its buffer is full.

The function f open can now be written. Most of f open is concerned
with getting the file opened and positioned at the right place, and setting the
flag bits to indicate the proper state. fopen does not allocate any buffer
space; this is done by \_fillbuf when the file is first read.

return(NULL);

fp-\&gt;\_f lag &amp;= -LREAD I \_WRITE);

fp-\&gt;\_f lag 1= (\*mode == &#39;r&#39;) ? \_READ : \_WRITE;

return(fp);

The function fillbuf is rather more complicated. The main com­
plexity lies in the fact that \_fillbuf attempts to permit access to the file
even though there may not be enough memory to buffer the I/O. If space
for a new buffer can be obtained from cal loc, all is well; if not,
\_fillbuf does unbuffered I/O using a single character stored in a private
array.

else

fp-\&gt;\_flag I= \_ERR;

fp-\&gt;\_cnt = 0;

return (EOF);

return(\*fp-\&gt;\_ptr++ &amp; 0377); /\* make char positive \*/

The first call to getc for a particular file finds a count of zero, which forces
a call of \_fillbuf. If \_fillbuf finds that the file is not open for read­
ing, it returns EOF immediately. Otherwise, it tries to allocate a large
buffer, and, failing that, a single character buffer, setting the buffering infor­
mation in \_flag appropriately.

Once the buffer is established, \_fillbuf simply calls read to fill it,
SOS the count and pointers, and returns the character at the beginning of
the buffer. Subsequent calls to \_fillbuf will find a buffer allocated.

The only remaining loose end is how everything gets started. The array
\_iob must be defined and initialized for stdin, stdout and stderr:

FILE \_iob[\_NFILE] =(

( NULL, 0, NULL, \_READ, 0 ), /\* stdin \*/

( NULL, 0, NULL, \_WRITE, 1 ), /\* stdout \*/

( NULL, 0, NULL, \_WRITE I \_UNBUF, 2 ) /\* stderr \*/
;

CHAPTER 8 THE UNIX SYSTEM INTERFACE 169

The initialization of the \_flag part of the structure shows that stdin is to
be read, stdout is to be written, and stderr is to be written unbuffered.

Exercise 8-3. Rewrite f open and \_fillbuf with fields instead of explicit
bit operations. 0

Exercise 8-4. Design and write the routines \_flushbuf and fclose. 0
Exercise 8-5. The standard library provides a function

fseek(fp, offset, &#39;origin)

which is identical to lseek except that fp is a file pointer instead of a file
descriptor. Write f seek. Make sure that your f seek coordinates properly
with the buffering done for the other functions of the library. CI

8.6 Example — Listing Directories

A different kind of file system interaction is sometimes called for —
determining information _about_ a file, not what it contains. The UNIX com­
mand _Is_ (&quot;list directory&quot;) is an example — it prints the names of files in a
directory, and optionally, other information, such as sizes, permissions, and
so on.

Since on UNIX at least a directory is just a file, there is nothing special
about a command like _/s;_ it reads a file and picks out the relevant parts of
the information it finds there. Nonetheless, the format of that information
is determined by the system, not by a user program, so _/s_ needs to know
how the system represents things.

We will illustrate some of this by writing a program called _fsize. fsize_ is
a special form of _/s_ which prints the sizes of all files named in its argument
list. If one of the files is a directory, _fsize_ applies itself recursively to that
directory. If there are no arguments at all, it processes the current directory.

To begin, a short review of file system structure. A directory is a file
that contains a list of file names and some indication of where they are
located. The &quot;location&quot; is actually an index into another table called the
&quot;mode table.&quot; The mode for a file is where all information about a file
except its name is kept. A directory entry consists of only two items, an
mode number and the file name. The precise specification comes by includ­
ing the file sys/dir .h, which contains

170 THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CHAPTER8

#define DIRSIZ 14 /\* max length of file name \*/

struct direct /\* structure of directory entry \*/
(

ino\_t d\_ino; /\* mode number \*/

char d\_name[DIRSIZ]; /\* file name \*/
) ;

The &quot;type&quot; ino\_t is a typedef describing the index into the mode
table. It happens to be unsigned on PDP-11, UNIX, but this is not the sort
of information to embed in a program: it might be different on a different
system. Hence the typedef. A complete set of &quot;system&quot; types is found
in sys/types .h.

The function stat takes a file name and returns all of the information
in the mode for that file (or —1 if there is an error). That is,

struct stat stbuf;
 char \*name;

stat(name, &amp;stbuf);

fills the structure stbuf with the mode information for the file name. The
structure describing the value returned by stat is in sys/stat .h, and
looks like this:

| struct stat
(dev\_t
ino\_t | /\* structure returned by stat \*/st\_dev; /\* device of mode \*/st\_ino; /\* mode number \*/ |
| --- | --- |
| short | st\_mode; | /\* | mode bits \*/ |
| short | st\_nlink; | /\* | number of links to file \*/ |
| short | st\_uid; | /\* | owner&#39;s userid \*/ |
| short | st\_gid; | /\* | owner&#39;s group id \*/ |
| dev\_t | st\_rdev; | /\* | for special files \*/ |
| off\_t | st\_size; | /\* | file size in characters \*/ |
| time\_t | st\_atime; | /\* | time last accessed \*/ |
| time\_t | st\_mtime; | /\* | time last modified \*/ |
| time\_t | st\_ctime; | /\* | time originally created \*/ |

);

Most of these are explained by the comment fields. The st\_mode entry
contains a set of flags describing the file; for convenience, the flag
definitions are also part of the file sys/stat . h.

Now we are able to write the program _fsize._ If the mode obtained from
stat indicates that a file is not a directory, then the size is at hand and can
be printed directly. If it is a directory, however, then we have to process
that directory one file at a time; it in turn may contain sub-directories, so
the process is recursive.

The main routine as usual deals primarily with command-line argu­
ments; it hands each argument to the function fsize in a big buffer.

fsize(buf);

The function fsize prints the size of the file. If the file is a directory,
however, fsize first calls directory to handle all the files in it. Note
the use of the flag names S\_IFMT and S\_IFDIR from stat .h.

with.

)

If a directory slot is not currently in use (because a file has been
removed), the mode entry is zero, and this position is skipped. Each direc­
tory also contains entries for itself, called &quot; . &quot;, and its parent, &quot; . . &quot;; clearly

CHAPTER 8 THE UNIX SYSTEM INTERFACE 173

these must also be skipped, or the program will run for quite a while.

Although the _fsize_ program is rather specialized, it does indicate a couple
of important ideas. First, many programs are not &quot;system programs&quot;; they
merely use information whose form or content is maintained by the operat­
ing system. Second, for such programs, it is crucial that the representation
of the information appear only in standard &quot;header files&quot; like stat.h and
dir.h, and that programs include those files instead of embedding the
actual declarations in themselves.

8.7 Example — A Storage Allocator

In Chapter 5, we presented a simple-minded version of alloc. The
version which we will now write is unrestricted: calls to alloc and free
may be intermixed in any order; alloc calls upon the operating system to
obtain more memory as necessary. Besides being useful in their own right,
these routines illustrate some of the considerations involved in writing
machine-dependent code in a relatively machine-independent way, and also
show a real-life application of structures, unions and typedef.

Rather than allocating from a compiled-in fixed-sized array, alloc will
request space from the operating system as needed. Since other activities in
the program may also request space asynchronously, the space alloc
manages may not be contiguous. Thus its free storage is kept as a chain of
free blocks. Each block contains a size, a pointer to the next block, and the
space itself. The blocks are kept in order of increasing storage address, and
the last block (highest address) points to the first, so the chain is actually a
ring.

When a request is made, the free list is scanned until a big enough
block is found. If the block is exactly the size requested it is unlinked from
the list and returned to the user. If the block is too big, it is split, and the
proper amount is returned to the user while the residue is put back on the
free list. If no big enough block is found, another block is obtained from
the operating system and linked into the free list; searching then resumes.

Freeing also causes a search of the free list, to find the proper place to
insert the block being freed. If the block being freed is adjacent to a free
list block on either side, it is coalesced with it into a single bigger block, so
storage does not become too fragmented. Determining adjacency is easy
because the free list is maintained in storage order.

One problem, which we alluded to in Chapter 5, is to ensure that the
storage returned by alloc is aligned properly for the objects that will be
stored in it. Although machines vary, for each machine there is a most res­
trictive type: if the most restricted type can be stored at a particular address,
all other types may be also. For example, on the IBM 360/370, the
Honeywell 6000, and many other machines, any object may be stored on a
boundary appropriate for a double; on the PDP-11, int suffices.

174 THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CHAPTER 8

A free block contains a pointer to the next block in the chain, a record
of the size of the block, and then the free space itself; the control informa­
tion at the beginning is called the &quot;header.&quot; To simplify alignment, all
blocks are multiples of the header size, and the header is aligned properly.
This is achieved by a union that contains the desired header structure and an
instance of the most restrictive alignment type:

typedef int ALIGN; /\* forces alignment on PDP-11 \*/

union header ( /\* free block header \*/

struct

union header \*ptr; /\* next free block \*/

unsigned size; /\* size of this free block \*/

) s;

ALIGN x; /\* force alignment of blocks \*/

) ;

typedef union header HEADER;

In alloc, the requested size in characters is rounded up to the proper
number of header-sized units; the actual block that will be allocated contains
one more unit, for the header itself, and this is the value recorded in the
size field of the header. The pointer returned by alloc points at the free
space, not at the header itself.

CHAPTER 8 THE UNIX SYSTEM INTERFACE 175

static HEADER base; /\* empty list to get started \*/
static HEADER \*allocp = NULL; /\* last allocated block \*/

char \*alloc(nbytes) /\* general-purpose storage allocator \*/
unsigned nbytes;

HEADER \*morecore();
 register HEADER \*p, \*q;
 register int nunits;

nunits = 1+(nbytes+sizeof(HEADER)-1)/sizeof(HEADER);

if ((ci = allocp) == NULL) ( /\* no free list yet \*/

base.s.ptr = allocp = q = &amp;base;

base.s.size = 0;

for (p=q-\&gt;s.ptr; ; q=p, p=p-\&gt;s.ptr) (

if (p-\&gt;s.size \&gt;= nunits) ( /\* big enough \*/
 if (p-\&gt;s.size == nunits) /\* exactly \*/
q-\&gt;s.ptr = p-\&gt;s.ptr;

else ( /\* allocate tail end \*/

p-\&gt;s.size -= nunits;

p += p-\&gt;s.size;

p-\&gt;s.size = nunits;

allocp = q;

return((char \*)(p+1));

if (p == allocp) /\* wrapped around free list \*/
if ((p = morecore(nunits)) == NULL)
return(NULL); /\* none left \*/

The variable base is used to get started; if allocp is NULL, as it is at
the first call of alloc, then a degenerate free list is created: it contains one
block of size zero, and points to itself. In any case, the free list is then
searched. The search for a free block of adequate size begins at the point
(allocp) where the last block was found; this strategy helps keep the list
homogeneous. If a too-big block is found, the tail end is returned to the
user; in this way the header of the original needs only to have its size
adjusted. In all cases, the pointer returned to the user is to the actual free
area, which is one unit beyond the header. Notice that p is converted to a
character pointer before being returned by alloc.

The function morecore obtains storage from the operating system.
The details of how this is done of course vary from system to system. In
UNIX, the system entry sbrk(n) returns a pointer to n more bytes of
storage. (The pointer satisfies all alignment restrictions.) Since asking the

176 THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CHAPTER 8

system for memory is a comparatively expensive operation, we don&#39;t want to
do that on every call to al loc, so morecore rounds up the number of
units requested of it to a larger value; this larger block will be chopped up as
needed. The amount of scaling is a parameter that can be tuned as needed.

#define NALLOC 128 /\* #units to allocate at once \*/

static HEADER \*morecore(nu) /\* ask system for memory \*/

unsigned nu;

char \*sbrk();

register char \*cp;
 register HEADER \*up;
 register int mu;

mu = NALLOC \* ((nu+NALLOC-1) / NALLOC);

cp = sbrk (mu \* sizeof(HEADER));

if ((int)cp == -1) /\* no space at all \*/

return(NULL);

up = (HEADER \*)cp;

up-\&gt;s.size = mu;

free ((char \*)(up+1));

return(allocp);

sbrk returns —1 if there was no space, even though NULL would have
been a better choice. The —1 must be converted to an int so it can be
safely compared. Again, casts are heavily used so the function is relatively
immune to the details of pointer representation on different machines.

free itself is the last thing. It simply scans the free list, starting at
allocp, looking for the place to insert the free block. This is either
between two existing blocks or at one end of the list. In any case, if the
block being freed is adjacent to either neighbor, the adjacent blocks are com­
bined. The only troubles are keeping the pointers pointing to the right
things and the sizes correct.

free(ap) /\* put block ap in free list \*/
 char \*ap;

register HEADER \*p, \*q;

p = (HEADER \*)ap - 1; /\* point to header \*/

 if (q \&gt;= q-\&gt;s.ptr &amp;&amp; (p \&gt; q II p \&lt; q-\&gt;s.ptr))

p-\&gt;s.ptr = q-\&gt;s.ptr-\&gt;s.ptr;

) else

p-\&gt;s.ptr = q-\&gt;s.ptr;

if (q+q-\&gt;s.size == p) ( /\* join to lower nbr \*/

q-\&gt;s.size += p-\&gt;s.size;

q-\&gt;s.ptr = p-\&gt;s.ptr;

) else

q-\&gt;s.ptr = p;

allocp = q;

Although storage allocation is intrinsically machine dependent, the code
shown above illustrates how the machine dependencies can be controlled
and confined to a very small part of the program. The use of typedef and
union handles alignment (given that sbrk supplies an appropriate pointer).
Casts arrange that pointer conversions are made explicit, and even cope with
a badly-designed system interface. Even though the details here are related
to storage allocation, the general approach is applicable to other situations as
well.

Exercise 8-6. The standard library function ca (n, size) returns a

pointer to n objects of size size, with the storage initialized to zero. Write
ca 3.1oc, using alloc either as a model or as a function to be called. 0

Exercise 8-7. alloc accepts a size request without checking its plausibility;
free believes that the block it is asked to free contains a valid size field.
Improve these routines to take more pains with error checking. 0

Exercise 8-8. Write a routine bfree (p, n) which will free an arbitrary
block p of n characters into the free list maintained by alloc and free.
By using bfree, a user can add a static or external array to the free list at
any time. 0
