C Programming for Everybody (CC4E)
This course and web site is dedicated to learning the "classic" version of the C
Programming language from the 1978 book written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.

This book places the reader in the middle of the 1970's transition from a
hardware-centered computer science to a focus on writing portable and efficient
software. C was used to develop operating systems like Unix, Minix, and Linux.

Programming languages like Python, Perl, Java, JavaScript, and Ruby are all written
in C. Software like the early TCP/IP networking implementations that made the Internet
possible were written in C. And the first web browsers and web servers were written in C.

Writing software in C enabled major advances in computer architecture and performance.
Operating systems, compilers, and utilities could be re-compiled to work a new hardware
platform once we had a C compiler for the new hardware.

So much software has been written in C over the past 40 years, that there is a
very good chance that much of the software that you each day use was either written
in C or written in a programming language that was written in C.

So we study C less as a programming language to use on a daily basis and more as
the foundation of modern software and computing. In many ways, C is the technology
equivalent of the "Rosetta Stone" in that it provides a connection between the
programming languages of past and the programming languages of the present.

The name "CC4E" in www.cc4e.com refers to the original UNIX command "CC" which
was the command you used to compile your C programs. CC stood for "C Compiler"
and is featured on the first page of the first chapter of the K&R C book. Programmers
like me from the 1970's and 1980's typed CC on UNIX systems like the AT&T 3B2 to
compile and run their first "hello world" program in C.

This material is being presented under Fair Use, as we are making use of material
from a copyrighted work that is out of print and not broadly available in any format.
The book is also not available in any accessible format. We are making use of this
material in a teaching and research context with a focus on studying its contribution
to computing history.

This material is available for free and online to anyone who wants to learn about
the history of the C Language, computing, and computer architecture.

Welcome to the course.
