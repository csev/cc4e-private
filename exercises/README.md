K&R Exercise Solutions
----------------------

This is the folder for the book's exercise solutions.

Name the files with the exercise number - for example:

**Exercise 1-2.** Experiment to find out what happens when printf's
argument string contains `\x`, where `x` is some character not listed above.

Should be in a file `ex_01_02.c`

Also include a `unit.sh` that compiles and runs each example.

If some sample input is required - name the file `in_01_02.txt`
